We are hosting a Ministry Fair where churches and other Christian organizations can 
share how they are living out the call to be Jesus's hands and feet for people in 
our community. This sharing can also include recruiting volunteers from people who attend.

The fair will be on April 11, 2026 (10am - 4pm) at the Agnew Friends Hall ([1241 N Barr Rd, Port Angeles](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QTBmWEzttu7UT6Ky9)).
